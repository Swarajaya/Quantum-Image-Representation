# Quantum-Image-Representation
This project presents a comparative experimental study of quantum image representation techniques and proposes a novel Hybrid Adaptive Quantum Image Representation (HA-QIR) method. The study evaluates how different quantum encoding schemes represent classical images in quantum states under limited quantum resources.
